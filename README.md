# A manifesto for a better tommorow

## Problems as I see them

* Exploitation of people for personal gain
* Wasteful living
* Money as only metric
* Stressful living

## Solutions as I see them

### Shared ownership of real estate and other assets

* Land
* Buildings (Communal Space)
* Equipment

### Network organisation

* Cell based (replication)
* Core DNA encoded in principles and ledger as backbone infrastructure of network
* International network of places for living and working

#### How the network interacts with the outside economy

* All external world capital is backed by assets such as real estate
* Capital can be raised to buy new assets and shares are issued
* Shares can be sold

### Cooperative Enterprise

* Goodwill gained by accomplishment

### System enforced limits to profit

* Full transparency of transactions

### Time as a measure of contribution

In principle an hour spent by any member of a community has the same value as a percentage of the hours a person has to spend during his or her lifetime. Each person can contribute to their own capability and capacity.

### Participative Governance

* Transparency and availability of data

### Smart contracts

* All contracts signed and verified by blockchain
* Signed by mandate

## Core principles

* We are not motivated by materialism
* Anybody can join or leave any time.
* There is no single truth or doctrine. We try to provide a basic framework and a set of tools. Every cell or member of the network has full autonomy.
* Our activities should be sustainable and at least carbon neutral
